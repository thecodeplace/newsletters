						<h3>About IAF</h3>
						<p>Facilitation is a profession rapidly taking its unique place alongside those of consulting and training. The International Association of Facilitation <a href="#">(www.iaf-world.org)</a> was formed by a group of professionals designing an avenue for interchange, professional development, trend analysis and peer networking. A formal association was proposed and adopted at a networking conference in Alexandria, Virginia, in January, 1994.More than 70 people signed on as charter members. Since then the IAF has grown to over 1500 members in more than 63 countries. Our members work in government, nonprofit, educational, community and corporate environments and hold positions as consultants, teacher, in-house facilitators, negotiators, organizational specialists, coaches among others.</p>
						<h4>About the Conference</h4>
